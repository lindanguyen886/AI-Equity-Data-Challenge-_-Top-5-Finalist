# AI-Equity-Data-Challenge-_-Top-5-Finalist
**Project Overview**
This project was completed as part of a national AI Equity Data Challenge organized by TECHNATION Canada. The objective was to analyze the impact of artificial intelligence adoption on the Canadian workforce, with a focus on wage disparities, workforce inclusion, and structural barriers affecting underrepresented groups. The project was structured in two phases: 
•	Phase 1 focused on identifying the current state and key challenges
•	Phase 2 focused on developing evidence-based solutions and policy recommendations.
**Problem Statement**
AI adoption in Canada is accelerating unevenly across industries and demographic groups. High-exposure industries benefit from productivity and wage premiums, while women and early-career workers face limited access to AI-complementary roles. The challenge was to identify data-driven evidence of these gaps and propose actionable solutions aligned with workforce development and economic sustainability.
**Data & Methodology**
•	Analyzed national labor market datasets related to industry employment, wages, and AI exposure.
•	Performed data cleaning, transformation, and validation using SQL, Python and Microsoft Excel.
•	Identify trends and disparities.
•	Conducted comparative analysis across industries, regions, and demographic groups.
**Key Analytical Contributions**
•	Identified wage differentials between high and low AI-exposure occupations, including gender-based gaps.
•	Analyzed declining entry-level opportunities in AI-affected sectors and long-term career implications.
•	Translated quantitative findings into structured insights for decision-making.
**Tools & Technologies**
Python, Microsoft Excel, Canva (data storytelling and presentation).
**Outcome**
Recognized as a Top 5 finalist nationally, validating the project’s analytical rigor, clarity of insights, and relevance to real-world data-driven decision-making.
